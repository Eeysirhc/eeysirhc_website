<p>When I joined SEOgadget last year, my first blog post was about <a href="http://seogadget.com/using-webkit2png-audits-stalking-more/">using webkit2png for site audits, stalking and more</a>.  What I didn’t mention was my 2013 new years resolution - to track the home page of three websites for the entire year with webkit2png.</p>
<p>The following videos come from the home pages of Macy’s, Yahoo and Amazon with a years worth of images compiled together.  It’s nothing too crazy but feel free to turn on your favorite jam, sit back, relax and view them for your pleasure.</p>
<p>Enjoy and have an amazing 2014!  =]</p>
