<p>I love <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/category/search-engine-optimization/">optimizing websites for search engines</a> so much I regularly do consulting work on the side.  But what I love more than <em>THAT</em> is showing clients the amazing year-over-year results of a successful SEO campaign.</p>
<p>The data from the images below come from an eCommerce website in an extremely competitive niche.  When I first started in April 2011, they received an average of 80 visits per day; that number jumped to ~200 visits per day - a 150% increase!</p>
<p>Here’s how their weekly organic traffic (excludes branded terms and not provided) looks like for the past year:</p>
<p><img src="/images/organic-traffic.png" /></p>
<p>And here’s the month over month comparison:</p>
<p><img src="/images/overall-compare.png" /></p>
<p>It goes without saying that looking at overall traffic doesn’t tell you much so I segmented by their product category pages (excludes branded terms and not provided):</p>
<p><img src="/images/category-traffic.png" /></p>
<p>And the month over month comparison:</p>
<p><img src="/images/category-compare.png" /></p>
<p>And yes, I know the user engagement rates are pretty terrible but there was nothing I could do about it since getting any UX/Design changes done was like walking through a (political) mine field.</p>
<p>What did I do to get all this free traffic?  Nothing you probably couldn’t find reading <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog">the</a> <a href="http://www.distilled.net/blog/">various</a> <a href="https://seogadget.co.uk/blog/">blogs</a> <a href="http://www.ninebyblue.com/blog/">out</a> <a href="http://www.portent.com/blog/">there</a>.  If you’re looking for specifics, here’s a quick hit list in the order the projects were executed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong> - they just weren’t targeting the right keywords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Source Code Optimization</strong> - involved many crucial on-page elements such as the title, h1 and body text.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Infrastructure Optimization</strong> - dealt with cleaning up the domain by addressing canonicalization issues, HTTP responses and robots exclusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/the-power-of-internal-link-building/">Internal Link Building</a></strong> - cross linked their various category and product pages to improve crawler access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Creation</strong> - managed a team of two outsourced content writers for the company blog.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External Link Building</strong> - hired, trained and managed a team of three link builders for website outreach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digital Asset Optimization</strong> - focused primarily on image optimization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that helped was a healthy dose of optimism, perseverance to succeed and a little <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-talks-penguin-update-recover-negative-seo-120463">algorithm change from Google</a>.</p>
