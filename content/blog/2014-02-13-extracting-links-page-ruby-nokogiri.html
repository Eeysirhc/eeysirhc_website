<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd">Scraper</a> is a pretty good Chrome extension I use on a regular basis to quickly extract links from a page. Unfortunately, there can be rare instances where it actually takes more effort to use.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to retrieve all links from Hewlett-Packard’s <a href="http://shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/static/page-sitemap">HTML sitemap</a>, I would need to create multiple Google spreadsheets to capture that data because of the way the page is structured. In this particular case, I’d have to scrape the page a total of 14 times to account for the different sections.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/scraper_example.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">scraper_example</p>
</div>
<p>With Ruby and <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> though (an amazing web parsing Ruby gem that I could never do without), I can effortlessly extract all links from any given page with just a few lines of code.  With that in mind, the code block below is what I used to accomplish this task.</p>
<pre><code>require &#39;nokogiri&#39;
require &#39;open-uri&#39;

url = &quot;http://shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/static/page-sitemap&quot;

page = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url))

links = page.css(&#39;div.gd-grid-4 a&#39;).map { |link| link[&#39;href&#39;]}

puts links</code></pre>
<p>A couple things to note if you decide to use this: the first is you obviously want to change the “url” variable (line 5) to your target web page.  The second is revising the “div.gd-grid-4” part (line 9) - this is dependent on how the target page was developed so you’ll need some developer tools to get your own answer here.</p>
