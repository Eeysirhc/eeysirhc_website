When I joined SEOgadget last year, my first blog post was about [using webkit2png for site audits, stalking and more](http://seogadget.com/using-webkit2png-audits-stalking-more/).  What I didn't mention was my 2013 new years resolution - to track the home page of three websites for the entire year with webkit2png.

The following videos come from the home pages of Macy's, Yahoo and Amazon with a years worth of images compiled together.  It's nothing too crazy but feel free to turn on your favorite jam, sit back, relax and view them for your pleasure.

Enjoy and have an amazing 2014!  =]
