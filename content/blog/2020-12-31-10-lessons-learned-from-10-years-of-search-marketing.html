<p>July 2020 marked the 10 year anniversary for my blog.</p>
<p>If you asked me a decade ago what I would be blogging about now my answer would be SEO. I never would have guessed it would shift to data science and data visualization topics.</p>
<p>To end this chaotic year on a high note I want to share the top 10 things I learned over the course of my career in search engine marketing. I hope someone will find this useful regardless of industry and tenure in their field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Listen</strong>: the most undervalued and underrated skill in the job market</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bias for action</strong>: this keeps momentum going to find out what works or doesn’t work</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.christopheryee.org/blog/on-deep-work/">Deep work</a></strong>: learn how to focus because you do not need any more productivity hacks/tools</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show don’t tell</strong>: always easier to convince others when the work is 70% completed</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay humble</strong>: never stop learning and always be the student</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start small</strong>: stay scrappy to test things out even if it is not perfect</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know what you are optimizing for</strong>: Time? Fame? Fortune?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be a storyteller</strong>: this inspires change in others</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.christopheryee.org/categories/tidytuesday/">A picture is worth a thousand words</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Life is a series of opportunity costs</strong>: you got to where you are today by not choosing hundreds of other perfectly viable options</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to meet a lot of amazing and helpful people along the way. My wish is that I can do the same for others.</p>
<p>Cheers to 2021 and beyond!</p>
