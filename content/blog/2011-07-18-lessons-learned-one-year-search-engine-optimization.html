<p>Wow - <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org">this blog</a> is officially ONE YEAR OLD!  I have learned a lot about the art and science of search engine optimization since my <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/let-my-seo-journey-begin/">journey began</a> and I must admit it has been quite an experience.  Below are some of the lessons learned these past 12 months in no particular order of importance.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Want to propose an SEO change?  Justify it with numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>People <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/funny-interesting-search-phrases-2010/">search for the darn-est things</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading a book (or blog post) written by an industry leader is different than actually doing it yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you aren’t tech savvy learn a little programming - you’ll see the world in a different set of lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Record EVERYTHING you do - from server end changes to <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/category/link-building/">link acquisition</a> dates and more.</p></li>
<li><p>Google won’t be around forever - optimize for the user first (cliche but still important).</p></li>
<li><p>Excel is an SEO’s best friend.</p></li>
<li><p>The SEO industry (and world) is a small place - work hard and don’t f**k up because word gets around.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/5-ways-to-weed-out-bad-seos-like-an-seo/">Search engines have a lot of work to do to combat spam</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an SEO mentor at the beginning of your career who will go above and beyond the call of duty to help refine your skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS - the internet is built on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Take all industry news with a grain of salt.</p></li>
<li><p>New to the SEO world?  <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/freelance-seo-important-for-beginners/">Freelance for small businesses</a> - their websites are usually outdated and could use the help.</p></li>
<li><p>Developers can be your best friend or worse enemy - make them the former.</p></li>
<li><p>98% of all reports are useless - don’t create them unless you include action items.</p></li>
<li><p>79% of all statistics are made up on the spot.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor your web traffic like a newborn baby.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/category/seo-tools/">SEO tools</a> are only as effective as its user.</p></li>
<li><p>Link development is the most grueling and time consuming SEO task - yet it’s the most important.</p></li>
<li><p>Just because one SEO tactic worked for somebody else doesn’t mean it’ll work for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a break and get some sunlight.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And with that, we are officially half way through 2011!</p>
