<p>To get yourself up to speed, I would recommend reading part uno of this two part series - <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/domain-change-and-duplicate-content/">Domain Change and Duplicate Content</a>.</p>
<p>But first, allow me to bask in my own glory as I provide an update on my current search engine rankings for this blog.
<strong>seo chris yee</strong> - #2 on Google; #1 on Bing/Yahoo
<strong>seo christopher yee </strong>- #2 on Google; #1 on Bing/Yahoo
<strong>christopher yee</strong>- #38 on Google; &gt;100 on Bing/Yahoo</p>
<p>An interesting thing that I noticed is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/seochrisyee">my LinkedIn profile</a> is no longer #1 on Google but instead has been replaced by LinkedIn’s directory for “Christopher Yee.”  I’ve already optimized my LinkedIn for “seo christopher yee” but I guess Googlebot doesn’t scour individual profiles frequently.</p>
<p>Another SERP breakthrough is ranking #38 on Google for my name by itself, “<a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/">christopher yee</a>.”  I thought I’d never get up there since position #1 and #2 are domains that have around for 5+ years.  I have no clue what is going on with the Bing/Yahoo search engine though.</p>
<p>Anyways, it has taken Google about a month to index my site since I changed domains from cyee428.wordpress to seochristopheryee.wordpress.  When I first started SEO Adventures, it took about 2 weeks to get it indexed.  So why did it take the latter domain so long?</p>
<p>I originally thought it was a duplicate content issue because the search engines still had cyee428 indexed.  I mean, it was a pretty legitimate reason since I didn’t see ANYTHING indexed for the longest time.  Then I realized my mistake - I forgot to submit my new blog to Google.</p>
<p><em>Lame.</em></p>
<p>I can hear my mom nagging me now, “look before you leap!”  Even though my experiment was a failure due to absent-mindedness (noob), we can still learn something here - <strong>your website doesn’t exist unless you submit it to Google</strong>.  Oh, and of course, plan ahead before you carry out an SEO test.</p>
<p>I’m out and about!</p>
