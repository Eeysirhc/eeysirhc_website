<p>When I first started this blog a little over a year ago, its main purpose was to act as my resume. It was to show potential employers that even though I had no knowledge about the SEO industry, I was very passionate about it. I made it my goal to write at least one blog post per month even though there wasn’t any real value to it. But that will all be changing soon as I have finally decided to migrate over to the paid version of WordPress - with new goals in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Branding and Reputation</strong>
To be successful in the fledgling world of SEO, I have noticed you need to have a strong personal brand and reputation. You need to represent something and fight for what you believe in. For instance, the CEO of SEOmoz, <a href="http://randfishkin.com/blog/">Rand Fishkin</a> is recognized as an industry leader who is more than willing to share his knowledge with others. <a href="http://www.rosshudgens.com/">Ross Hudgens</a> is one savvy link builder who advocates for getting $#!t done. And although his posts may be long-winded, <a href="http://www.seo-theory.com/">Michael Martinez</a> is best known for questioning some of the “best practices” in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Helps with Ranking….perhaps?</strong>
With the above goal in mind, removing the wordpress.com extension will not only be pleasing to the eye but I suspect it might even help me rank better. For the past year I pretty much stayed steadily at #23 in Google for “<a href="http://www.christopheryee.org">Christopher Yee</a>.” Although I never did any “real” link building, I have a feeling using free version of wordpress may not help much if you are trying to rank for a competitive keyword such as my name. Maybe because it’s a gateway drug for spam bots? Or maybe because it’s not a unique domain? Maybe both? Or neither? I don’t know but I’ll definitely test it out by not link building for another year - LOL.</p>
<p><strong>Highly Customizable</strong>
I’ve used the paid version of Wordpress before and I think it’s absolutely amazing. The paid version is highly customizable and you can pretty much do anything you want with it - add new widgets, change the CSS, change the layout, implement advertisements, etc. The possibilities are endless! The free version is great and all but as you may have noticed, I am tied down to one single blog theme and no customization is allowed.</p>
<p>That being said, stay tuned as you should see a new domain name very soon. Oh, and I probably won’t redirect my old link juice because let’s be honest - I never really had any.</p>
