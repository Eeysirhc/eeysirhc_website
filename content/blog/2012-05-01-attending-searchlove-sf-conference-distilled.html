I don’t have anything major to share this month besides the fact that I will be attending Distilled’s <a href="http://www.distilled.net/events/searchlove-san-francisco/">SearchLove conference in San Francisco</a> (not an affiliate link).  I am super excited about it and can’t believe it’s less than 1.5 months away!  If you plan to attend please <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/contact/">let me know</a> and we’ll meet up.

The only gripe I have with their marketing scheme is the fact that** BERKELEY IS NOT SAN FRANCISCO**.  It is a 30-45 minute drive away from The City….what an insult to us San Franciscans so get it right ya bloody blokes!
