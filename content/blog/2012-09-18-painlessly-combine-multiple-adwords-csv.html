<p>When I first started doing keyword research I found myself easily downloading 10+ CSV files from the Google Adwords Keyword Tool.  This became a (painful) problem because I had to manually copy and paste all the data into a single Excel file.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months when I finally found the perfect solution: using the <em>CAT</em> function (short for <em>CONCATENATE</em>) within the command line.  Mac users can get started immediately with their Terminal (located in the Utilities folder); Windows users will have to <a href="http://cygwin.com/install.html">download Cygwin</a>.</p>
<p>Are you ready for the super secret code to painlessly aggregate all your CSV files into a single document?  Here you go…</p>
<pre><code>cat *.csv &gt;&gt; OUTPUT_FILE.csv</code></pre>
<p>And this is how it looks like in action…</p>
<p><img src="/images/cat_final.png" /></p>
<p>The _*.csv_ portion of the code tells the computer to fetch all files ending in <em>.csv</em>.  The remaining line appends all the data into <em>OUTPUT_FILE.csv</em> or whatever you want to name it - in the image above it’s <em>combine.csv</em>.</p>
<p>Merging of your files should take less than 3 seconds.  Painless, right?!</p>
