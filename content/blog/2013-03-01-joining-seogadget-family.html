<p>This post is super late but if you didn’t know already I left my short tenure with Macy’s earlier this month and joined the SEOgadget family!</p>
<blockquote>
You can read my first SEOgadget blog post <a href="http://seogadget.com/using-webkit2png-audits-stalking-more/">here</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>I’m helping out <a href="https://twitter.com/lauralippay">Laura Lippay</a> expand the US office so I’ll be getting a taste of both agency and startup life.  Business is already booming and I’ve got so much work ahead we are looking to hire another Organic Search Strategist.  Yes, that’s right - I need a partner in crime!</p>
<p>These are not the official minimum requirements but what I think are the bare essentials.  Need to have a solid understanding of SEO and possess the three traits of success: hardworking, smart and passionate.  Everything else can be taught.</p>
<p>What do you get?  Super supportive management and colleagues (including the UK), weapons-grade computer, <a href="http://www.hatcherysf.com/">cool office space</a>, get to <a href="http://seogadget.com/sending-two-of-our-team-to-mozcon/">attend Mozcon 2013</a> and a whole lot more.</p>
<blockquote>
Everyone on the team has, or had at one point, a cat - you decide what to do with that information.
</blockquote>
<p>We’re pretty much offering services no other company is doing, innovating SEO techniques you don’t read in blogs and building out products vendors don’t even have.  It’s great stuff so <a href="http://seogadget.com/seo-jobs/">come join me</a>!!!</p>
<p>Oh, and you have to be based in San Francisco…for now.</p>
