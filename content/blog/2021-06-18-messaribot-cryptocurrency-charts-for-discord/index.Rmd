## tl;dr

**Messaribot** ([code](https://github.com/Eeysirhc/messaribot)) is a very simple bot which plots cryptocurrency data to assigned Discord channels. This is written in Python, crytpo data is pulled from the [Messari API](https://messari.io/api), and relies on the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API wrapper to publish the finished graphs.

## Overview

Most of the interesting crypto discussions happen on Discord (or Telegram). However, looking up market prices can be a hassle when you need to switch back and forth between different desktop or mobile apps.

Messaribot came as a result of this - a super lightweight tool to retrieve and visualize crypto data over Discord.

Although I am sharing a stripped down version there are three primary layers:

* Fetching data from the Messari API
* Creating the data visualization
* Pushing the graphs to Discord

The following is a high-level walkthrough of the main code chunks and general explanation for each.

## Dependencies

### API credentials

First things first: create an account with [Messari](https://messari.io/).

You can access the API without one but your maximum requests per day doubles... and it's FREE... so why not?

### Discord account

We will also need to enable our account to retrieve a secret token for the bot - here is an [easy guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) to follow along.

### Python modules

Last but not least, below are a few of the libraries we'll need for this to work.

```{python eval=FALSE}
import os
import sys
import requests

from io import StringIO
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, date 

import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import discord
```

## Fetch data

There are a few variables you can adjust to your liking:

* *Start date*: code defaults to 2020-01-01
* *End date*: code defaults to system date
* *API key*: insert your secret key

```{python eval=FALSE}
# END DATE
edate = datetime.today().date()

base_url = "https://data.messari.io/api/v1/assets/{coin}/metrics/price/time-series?start=2020-01-01&end={edate}&interval=1d&format=csv".format(coin=coin, edate=edate)

# MESSARI SECRET API KEY
api_key = "YOUR_MESSARI_API_KEY_HERE"
headers = {'x-messari-api-key': api_key}
```

## Create visualizations

### Compute statistics

After we fetch our cryptocurrency data, Messaribot then calculates some statistics:

* *Moving average*: based on the closing price using a 100 day rolling window
* *Volatility index*: difference between the daily closing price and moving average

```{python eval=FALSE}
# 100 DAY MOVING AVERAGE
df['price_ma'] = df.rolling(window=100)['close'].mean()

# VOLATILITY INDEX
df['price_volatility'] = df['close'] / df['price_ma'] - 1
```

The above uses my own [Turtle Trader Rules](https://www.turtletrader.com/rules/) so feel free to change to a shorter or longer time frame you are comfortable with.

### Build plots

The code below stacks one chart on top of the other.

* *Daily price*: closing price with a dotted line for the trended moving average
* *Volatility chart*: index which color codes the different buy/sell thresholds

```{python eval=FALSE}
# DAILY PRICE CHART
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(df.date, df.close)
plt.plot(df.date, df.price_ma, linestyle='--', color='salmon')
plt.fill_between(df.date.values, df.high, df.low, alpha=0.3)
plt.axhline(y=dx.close.item(), color='steelblue', linestyle=':')  
plt.ylabel("Price ($)")
plt.ylim(0, df.high.max()*1.20)
plt.title(title, fontsize=15, horizontalalignment='left', x=0.05)

# VOLATILITY INDEX CHART
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(df.date, df.price_volatility, color='black', alpha=0.5)
plt.axhline(y=0.40, color='red', linestyle=':')
plt.axhline(y=0.20, color='orange', linestyle=':')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='grey', linestyle=':')
plt.axhline(y=-0.20, color='green', linestyle=':')
plt.axhline(y=-0.40, color='steelblue', linestyle=':')
plt.fill_between(df.date.values, 0.20, 0.40, color='red', alpha=0.25)
plt.fill_between(df.date.values, 0.00, 0.20, color='orange', alpha=0.25)
plt.fill_between(df.date.values, 0.00, -0.20, color='green', alpha=0.25)
plt.fill_between(df.date.values, -0.20, -0.40, color='steelblue', alpha=0.25)
plt.ylabel("Volatility Index (%)")
plt.ylim(df.price_volatility.min()-0.5, df.price_volatility.max()+0.5)

plt.savefig("/YOUR/FILEPATH/NAME/HERE/toast.png")
```

Here is an example of what that final chart looks like for Bitcoin:

__NEED TWITTER TWEET EMBED HERE__

*(insert Inception joke here)*

> **Disclaimer**: not financial or investment advice.

The volatility index helps me make (somewhat) rational decisions for crypto trading.

For example, if a specific cryptocurrency price drops into the green region then I buy \$100. If it lands in the blue region then I double down at \$200. If it goes even lower than that? Triple down with \$300.

## Publish charts

### Discord interface

You will need to make two edits in this section of the source code.

* *Command prefix*: the default listens to Discord messages which start with **\$** but you can also set it to use periods, colons, exclamation marks, etc.
* *Token*: insert your super secret token for your Discord bot

```{python eval=FALSE}
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '$')
TOKEN = 'YOUR_DISCORD_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE'
```

And finally, the function below pulls everything together and pushes our crypto plots to the designated Discord channel.

```{python eval=FALSE}
@client.command()
async def messaribot(ctx, coin):
    coin = coin.upper()
    messari_fetch(coin)
    await ctx.send(file=discord.File(r'/YOUR/FILEPATH/NAME/HERE/toast.png'))
```

## Launching Messaribot

Fire up your command line and execute the following code:

```{python eval=FALSE}
python3 messaribot.py
```

Assuming everything works your Messaribot should now be online.

To have it return our predefined charts just run the function with the cryptocurrency of your choice:

```{python eval=FALSE}
$messaribot btc
```

### Bot server

One problem with the above: you can't run any other shell based programs or turn off your computer.

Hosting this on a dedicated server is outside the scope of this article but what I have done is port all files onto a Raspberry Pi. This ensures my Messaribot is running 24/7 so everyone in my Discord server can continue to use this while I am away.

## Wrapping up

Check it out and let me know what you think - I am always open to hearing how to make this better.

And if you *really* like it then don't hestitate to drop some coins into my [cryptojar](https://www.christopheryee.org/cryptojar/).

## Future work

* Error handling
* Throttling requests
* More plotting options
