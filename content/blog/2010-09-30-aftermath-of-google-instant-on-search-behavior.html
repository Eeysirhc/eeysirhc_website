<p>It has been three weeks since the <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/advent-of-google-instant/">advent of Google Instant</a> and there’s already 85 million search results for it - WOW!  That is very impressive….but then again, that’s the world wide web for yah.</p>
<p>In any case, I’d like to contribute to the search community regarding the aftermath of Google Instant’s impact on search behavior.  This article is based on blog posts from <a href="http://blog.conductor.com/2010/09/what%E2%80%99s-been-the-impact-of-google-instant-on-searcher-behavior-so-far-not-much/">Conductor</a>, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/google-instant-fewer-changes-to-seo-than-the-average-algo-update">SEOmoz</a> and <a href="http://www.distilled.co.uk/blog/seo/impact-of-google-instant/">Distilled</a>.</p>
<p>Unless I am mistaken, a thing to keep in mind is not everyone has Google Instant yet so the numbers will eventually change.  Also, I would like to thank Seer Interactive for their <a href="http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/does-google-instant-actually-affect-the-long-tail-free-downloadable-spreadsheet/2010/09/15/">free downloadable spreadsheet</a> - it has worked wonders!</p>
<p><strong>Quick Notes
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data is pulled from our US domain only</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring one week before and after Instant’s inception</p></li>
<li><p>Over 40,000 keywords</p></li>
<li><p>Weekly traffic averaging around 600,000 visits</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what the changes look like on a table for the percentage of total keywords.<img src="/images/cafepressus-googleinstantdata2.jpg" alt="Google Instant Data" /></p>
<p>Here it is in a graph illustrating the number of visits by search term length.</p>

</div>
<p>The distribution of traffic in the graph clearly shows there is no concrete evidence that Google Instant has changed search behavior.  Although there was a slight shift (.64%) from 4word keywords to 3word keywords, the difference is so minute that it’s insignificant.</p>
<p>I’d like to point out that we mainly aim for high demand head terms.  So instead of seeing a shift to long tail, our company might lean towards the left (shorter keywords) as portrayed above.  It’s something I will be keeping an eye on because it’s too soon to tell and as with everything else in SEO - patience is a virtue.</p>
