<p>Ask my wife anything about me and she’ll be the first to testify that I have more books than clothing (lol).</p>
<p>One book that dramatically changed my life and highly recommend reading is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">“Deep Work” by Cal Newport</a>.</p>

<p>Newport’s thesis can be summed up in a couple sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly <em>rare</em> at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly <em>valuable</em> in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He builds the case on why developing this deep work philosophy is valuable, rare, and meaningful in the “Intelligent Machine Age”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many distractions</li>
<li>More connected than ever before</li>
<li>Competing globally</li>
<li>There are only a few winners</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve success in the modern knowledge economy, the individual needs to master difficult subjects in a short amount of time while producing high quality work. Newport formulates this into an equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) * (Intensity of Focus)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite its simplicity, I think this formula operates similar to a loss function where over/under investment in either factors are penalized. Here is what that graph might look like:</p>

<p>This visualization makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>Not enough time and focus? It means the final output might oversimplify a very complex topic. Spent too much time and effort? Work quality decays because we get stuck in analysis paralysis mode.</p>
<p>Thus, to deliver exceptional work the goal is to significantly increase concentration levels while being cognizant on how much time we sink into the project.</p>

<p>How can someone intensify their focus in the age of unceasing distractions?</p>
<p>Below are a few starting points which have worked for me but I recommend a gradual shift rather than going cold turkey over night:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule time blocks on calendar dedicated to deep work</li>
<li>Actually turn off the computer at the end of the work day</li>
<li>Put cell phone on vibrate and leave it in a different room</li>
<li>Log off slack and other social media apps</li>
<li>Close email and turn off any desktop notifications during deep work</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, I am such a fan of this that <strong>I will purchase a copy of the book for you</strong> if you are unable to do so - no questions asked.</p>
