<p>Today marks the completion of my second week on the job!  And by job I mean as an SEO Analyst Intern at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">CafePress</a>.  My previous post, <a href="http://www.christopheryee.org/job-obtained-link-builder-intern/">Job Obtained: Link Builder Intern</a>, stated that I’m a Link Builder.  However, that’s incorrect because link building is actually INCLUDED in my duties as an SEO Analyst.  But to tell you the truth, I do WAYYY more than that (I’m not complainin’ of course!) and you’ll find a short list below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In-depth analysis of competitor websites</p></li>
<li><p>Generate, compile and analyze both weekly and monthly web traffic data</p></li>
<li><p>Manage numerous social media accounts (# of accounts classified) across various platforms</p></li>
<li><p>Active link building while keeping keyword anchor texts in mind</p></li>
<li><p>Community outreach</p></li>
<li><p>And more to come as the months progress!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll keep you all posted.  Enjoy your Labor Day Weekend because I know I will.   :-]</p>
