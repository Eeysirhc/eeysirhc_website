### [Jackie Chu](https://www.jackiecchu.com/), Global SEO Lead at Uber
> Chris is a great friend of mine but also a truly phenomenal SEO. I had long heard of Chris through friends and mentors alike, but we finally had a chance to work together when he was the SEO lead at Square where he led the program and drove all of our data science collaborations. During our time at Square the SEO team turned from mostly a brand play to being the largest generator of upmarket revenue for the company (which was > 90% of all GPV). He left such an impression on the Data Science team that after he left and they moved on to Stitch Fix, the Data Science lead insisted they must have a FTE data scientist to support SEO alone.

### [Manasa Danda](https://www.facebook.com/manasa.danda/), Engineering Manager at Uber
> Chris has been at the center of all Web Intelligence team's deliverables either leading, strategizing, analyzing data or writing business requirements with clear impact statements and milestones to reach there. He has been an integral part of every PRD review and the team feels confident when there is guidance and clarification from Chris while building a feature, or a UX change. Chris is equal parts a thinker and a listener. He has many times elevated my concerns or suggestions to larger groups and challenges approaches that he may see unfitting. The best part of working with Chris is his positive attitude which combined with his stellar business develpment skills and SEO knowledge makes him a great asset to the team.

I have worked with multiple SEO teams across different industries and haven't seen anyoen as obsessed with quantiative-focused on SEO as Chris. The focus on building towards higher efficiency for his team and all the teams using uTRAQ is an excellent example of serving everyone at Uber.

### [Wells Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wellsyu), Staff SEO Strategist at Uber
> Chris is an impressive problem solver, SQL expert, and has made an immense impact on not just our team but the entire business when he landed uTRAQ. The tool is amazing, and faster than any Tableau dashboard. He has done a great job in figuring out the problem areas from the team, doing user research, and working to improve what is available in uTRAQ. I am constantly learning new things from Chris, and he is my go-to person for the most complex problems.

He's innovative, thoughtful, always evolving, and always curious.
