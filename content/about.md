Howdy, you can call me Chris!

I work in the SEO Intelligence division at Uber creating bespoke internal products by leveraging software, data science, and adtech.

Prior to this I was the Director of Optimization at FT Optimize where we wrote custom software for our clients to achieve their search engine marketing goals efficiently and at scale. My team was responsible for optimizing over $45M in ad spend per year, developing proprietary SEM bidding algorithms, and engineering custom marketing automation technology.

Before agency life I built and led SEO teams for enterprise companies. We always had one goal in mind: change the internal perspective on what SEO is, what SEO can do, and where the future of SEO is headed. From this our team was able to inspire others, drive company direction, and positively impact the bottom line.

[For as long as I can remember](https://www.christopheryee.org/news/), I have been passionate about using data, storytelling, and programming to solve unique online acquisition problems. These days I am particularly interested in developing blockchain analytics software products with a core focus on the [Ergo platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/).

I am always open to hearing about new opportunities so please get in touch, I would love to hear from you!
