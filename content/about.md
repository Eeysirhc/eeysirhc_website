Howdy, you can call me Chris!

I work in the SEO Intelligence division at Uber creating bespoke internal products by leveraging software, data science, and adtech.

Prior to this I was the Director of Optimization at FT Optimize where we wrote custom software for our clients to achieve their search engine marketing goals efficiently and at scale. My team was responsible for optimizing over $45M in ad spend per year, developing proprietary SEM bidding algorithms, and engineering custom marketing automation technology.

Before agency life I built and led SEO teams for enterprise companies. We always had one goal in mind: change the internal perspective on what SEO is, what SEO can do, and where the future of SEO is headed. From this our team was able to inspire others, drive company direction, and positively impact the bottom line.

[For as long as I can remember](https://www.christopheryee.org/news/), I have been passionate about using data, storytelling, and programming to solve unique online acquisition problems. These days I am particularly interested in developing blockchain analytics software products with a core focus on the [Ergo platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/).

I am always open to hearing about new opportunities so please get in touch, I would love to hear from you!

### **People I've Worked With**

#### [Erin Renzas](http://www.linkedin.com/in/erinrenzas), SVP of Marketing at Checkout.com
> Sometimes you work with people who fundamentally change how you think about your work. Chris did that for me -- helping me to understand how our team could better leverage a technical approach to marketing to make our business better and move the bottom line. He's innovative, thoughtful, always evolving, and always curious.

#### [Jackie Chu](https://www.jackiecchu.com/), Global SEO Lead at Uber
> Chris is a great friend of mine but also a truly phenomenal SEO. I had long heard of Chris through friends and mentors alike, but we finally had a chance to work together when he was the SEO lead at Square where he led the program and drove all of our data science collaborations. During our time at Square the SEO team turned from mostly a brand play to being the largest generator of upmarket revenue for the company (which was > 90% of all GPV). He left such an impression on the Data Science team that after he left and they moved on to Stitch Fix, the Data Science lead insisted they must have a FTE data scientist to support SEO alone.

#### [Christal Tossany](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christaltossany/), Optimization Product Manager at Sephora
> Chris Yee taught me everything I know about digital marketing. The combination of his expertise in the space and friendly patient demeanor make him an excellent consultant. Chris can explain basic and advanced concepts while sharing both tactical and strategic initiatives to get your companyâ€™s digital marketing program up and running. He has a sharp mind, thinks out of the box, and is a real pleasure to work with.
